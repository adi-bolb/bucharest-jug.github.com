### Planning and organization

### Meetings sponsorship

Each edition JUG takes place in a room provided by one of our sponsors. Sponsors receive 5 minutes to present their company and what they have to offer.

To accommodate JUG is needed a room with a capacity of 50 + people provided with projection equipment.
