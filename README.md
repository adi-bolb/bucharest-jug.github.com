Bucharest Java / JVM User Group Page
====================================

Welcome! If you are a passionate developer using either Java, Scala, Groovy, Clojure or any other language based on the JVM (Java Virtual Machine) you are in the right place. Our plan is to organise a monthly face to face meeting with 2-3 presentations starting around 7PM and later on move to a pub for drinks.

You are invited to join the email list to stay in the loop. Take care!
